Queries Etherpad database for a list of all documents.  Generates
four static HTML files which present the list sorted by name,
creation date, modification date, and usage.

Note that the database connection parameters are hardcoded in 
the python script.  Change as needed.

When configured correctly with an apache home directory and 
cron job, this script can provide the much needed functionality
of finding stuff in etherpad.

usage:  list_etherpads.py <outputdir> <basename>

writes four html files to <outputdir>:
   <basename>_name.html
   <basename>_created.html  
   <basename>_modified.html  
   <basename>_usage.html
